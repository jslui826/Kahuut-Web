JSONWebToken is passed to the frontend to use after verification.
You require an .env file that is not present within this directory (obviously).
This .env file has the following structure:

DATABASE_URL=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
JWT_SECRET=...

JWT_SECRET was generated with:
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

python script.py /path/to/pdf /path/to/.env

Errors due to architecture of machine running bcrypt can occur. Solution is to just use the setup.sh since it removes
the node modules.
